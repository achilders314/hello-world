# hello-world
A place to try out new coding skills in some simple projects.
I'm an entry level developer looking to level up my coding skills.  I am already very familiar with HTML, CSS, and I'm brushing up on Java from the class I took in college.  I am looking to learn C#, React, and REST.  Probably JavaScript as well.
